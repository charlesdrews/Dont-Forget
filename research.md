# Research for the "Don't Forget" App

### Research Plan
1. *Title:* Weather notification app user study
2. *Authors / Stakeholders:* Charles Drews, charlesdrews@gmail.com
3. *Date:* March 18, 2016
4. *Background:* For GA ADI Project 4 I am interested in building an app that provides users very specific weather information via notifications so they don't even have to open the app. This study is intended to identify pain points such an app might alleviate, and features that would make such an app useful.
5. *Goals:* Determine what specific weather details users need each morning and the most effective means of delivering those details.
6. *Research Questions:*
  * Do users consider weather data on a daily basis?
  * What weather details inform a user's daily choices?
  * Are some delivery methods for weather data more effective than others?
  * How do users feel about automatic notifications vs. opening the app manually?
  * What time of day do users need weather info?
  * What non-weather info do users often forget, and would like reminders for?
7. *Methodology:* 10-15 minute interviews will be performed with each participant
8. *Participants:* Target audience is urban professionals in their 20s & 30s
9. *Schedule:* Interviews will take place March 17, 2016
10. *Script:*
  * Is weather info useful to you each morning?
  * What specific weather details are useful?
  * When do you want those details?
  * How do you want those details delivered?
  * What non-weather information reminders/notifications would be useful each day?
