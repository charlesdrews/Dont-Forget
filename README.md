Never get caught in the rain without an umbrella again! Don't Forget gives you timely notifications - customized to your daily routine - in three categories: weather, tasks/errands, and birthdays. These convenient reminders deliver essential data to make your simpler.

Weather reminders utilize data from Weather Underground (wunderground.com) and provide the essential info you need before you leave the house - likelihood of rain or snow, current, and daily high temps. Clicking through from the notification to the app itself gives you a complete view of current conditions, hourly forecasts (36 hours), and daily forecasts (10 days). Weather data is based on the device's current location, or if the user prefers, the app can use a manually-entered location instead. The user can also switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius at any time.

Task reminders are designed for time-sensitive errands. Need to mail a rent check on your way to work? No problem, add a "Before Work" reminder. Need to call your doctor during the day to schedule an appointment? Set a "Lunchtime" reminder. You can also choose "On the Way Home" for errands you need to run when you head out from work, and "Evening" for chores to do later. You can customize the time of day associated with each of those labels - set them once, then enjoy the simplicity of picking from four obvious labels each time you create a task.

Birthday reminders connect seamlessly to your Google Contacts and make sure you never miss a chance to send a friend or loved one your best wishes. The notification arrive automatically and include each person's age so you can customize a birthday greeting. You can also easily add and update your contacts' birthdays right from the app - no need to open a separate contacts manager. Don't want to be reminded of some contacts' birthdays? No problem, easily turn birthday notifications on and off by person with a single tap.
